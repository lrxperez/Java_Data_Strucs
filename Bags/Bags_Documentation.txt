 * Comments: I did not have a good handle on what was going on in this code. I had to do
 * a lot of research to understand everything that kept going wrong. Some were small mistakes,
 * but it was good practice in analyzing someone else's code and making adjustments. I'm
 * pretty sure what I ended up doing is on the clumsy side, so it would be good to see
 * examples of what would have worked better (after turning in the assignment of course).
